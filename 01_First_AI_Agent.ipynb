    "This notebook is the first step in my journey of learning about **Agentic AI**.  \n",
    "The idea behind Agentic AI is not just asking a model for a single response, but guiding it through **a sequence of reasoning steps**, where each step builds on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we simulate a simple agent workflow with three stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Industry Selection**  \n",
    "   Ask the LLM to pick a business area that might be worth exploring for an Agentic AI opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pain Point Identification**  \n",
    "   Once the industry is chosen, ask the LLM to highlight a **pain point** or challenge that makes the industry ripe for AI-driven solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agentic AI Proposal**  \n",
    "   Finally, request the LLM to propose a potential **Agentic AI solution** to address the identified challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the **OpenAI API** with environment variable management handled by `python-dotenv` for security and reproducibility.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The result will give us a structured example of how an LLM can be guided step by step to simulate agent-like behavior.\n"
